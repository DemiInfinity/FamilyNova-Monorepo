# FamilyNova Logo Guidelines

## Logo Usage

All FamilyNova apps should use a consistent logo/icon throughout the application.

### Android Apps
- **App Icon**: Use `@mipmap/ic_launcher` (the standard Android launcher icon)
- **In-App Logo**: Use `@mipmap/ic_launcher` for logo displays in login screens and headers

### iOS Apps
- **App Icon**: Use the FamilyNova app icon in Assets.xcassets
- **In-App Logo**: Use a consistent SF Symbol or custom logo asset
  - Recommended: `person.2.fill` for kids app (represents friends/community)
  - Recommended: `person.2.badge.shield.checkmark.fill` for parent app (represents protection/monitoring)

### Web App
- **Logo**: Use a consistent logo image or SVG
- **Favicon**: Use FamilyNova icon
- **In-App**: Display logo in headers and landing pages

## Brand Colors
- Kids Apps: Primary Blue (#4A90E2)
- Parent Apps: Primary Navy (#2C3E50) / Primary Teal (#16A085)

## Notes
- The original Android project uses the default Android launcher icon
- For production, create a custom FamilyNova logo that represents:
  - Safety and protection
  - Family and community
  - Trust and verification
  - Fun and friendly (for kids app)
  - Professional and trustworthy (for parent app)
